<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">The purpose of this example is to trace everything that occurs on a communication via socket, on a specific address, on a specific port. This example allows you to understand the principle of dialog via socket between two applications.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Therefore, in the applications that dialog via socket, even if no trace option as implemented by the developers, you will have he ability to view all the exchanges performed on the socket.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">This example also enables you to understand the operating mode of the network protocols based on the sockets: POP3, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, and so on.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Note for the users who are experienced in network communication: </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">This example does not allow you to trace the UDP packages (only the TCP communications can be traced).</span>
